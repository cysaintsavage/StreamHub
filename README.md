## How It Works

### IPTV Player
Loads curated free IPTV channels (beIN Sports, Fox Sports, etc.) and streams them via HLS.js through a local proxy to handle CORS.

### IPTV Catalog
Fetches the M3U playlist from `iptv-org/iptv` (~2.5MB), parses `#EXTINF` tags, and organizes channels by category. Supports search and country filtering.

### Live Sports
Connects to the SportSRC API to display upcoming match schedules. Selecting a match loads embedded stream players directly from `embed.st` (bypassing ad wrappers).
